/*
 * RandomWriter generates random prose by analyzing a text with a given Markov
 * length which defines the number of characters in key string. For each key, the
 * following character is tracked. The longest key becomes the starting seed of the
 * prose. The next character is determined by its frequency of occurence after the
 * seed. The next seed is therefore the seed (minus its first char) + nextChar.
 * 
 * MaxChars (2000) characters are printed for the prose.
